# FastSocket

FastSocket is an advanced, high-performance, event-driven real-time messaging and logging system designed to facilitate
scalable, maintainable, and efficient real-time applications. Leveraging a suite of modern technologies including
FastAPI, Socket.IO, AsyncAPI, Pydantic, Typer, Logfire, and ReactiveX (RxPY), FastSocket addresses the complexities of
real-time event handling, data validation, and reactive programming paradigms.

## Architecture Overview

### Microservice-like, Event-Driven Architecture

FastSocket adopts a microservice-like architecture, emphasizing modularity and separation of concerns. The core
components include:

- **FastAPI Server**: Serves as the asynchronous web server handling API requests and managing the application
  lifecycle.
- **Socket.IO Communication Layer**: Facilitates real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server,
  enabling instant event broadcasting and handling.
- **Event Registry and Handling System**: Dynamically registers and manages event handlers based on AsyncAPI
  specifications, ensuring that each event is processed accurately and efficiently.
- **CLI for Server and Log Management**: Provides an intuitive command-line interface built with Typer, allowing
  developers and administrators to manage server operations, event registrations, and log viewing seamlessly.
- **ReactiveX-based Event Stream Processing**: Implements reactive programming paradigms using RxPY to handle complex
  event streams, enabling responsive and scalable data flows.
- **Logfire Integrated Logging and Monitoring System**: Centralizes logging with Logfire, offering real-time log
  monitoring, search capabilities, and visual dashboards for enhanced observability.

### Data Flow

1. **Client Interaction**: Clients emit events via Socket.IO, initiating real-time interactions.
2. **Socket.IO Layer**: Receives events and forwards them to the FastAPI server for processing.
3. **FastAPI Server**: Routes events to the appropriate event handlers registered in the Event Registry.
4. **Event Handlers**: Process events, perform business logic, interact with databases or external services, and emit
   acknowledgments or responses back to clients.
5. **Reactive Streams**: Event data flows through ReactiveX streams for further processing, transformation, or
   aggregation as required.
6. **Logging**: All significant actions, errors, and events are logged using Logfire, ensuring comprehensive monitoring
   and debugging capabilities.

## Development Guidelines

### Asynchronous Programming

- **Consistency**: All I/O-bound operations should utilize Python's `async` and `await` syntax to ensure non-blocking
  behavior.
- **Concurrency**: Leverage FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities to handle multiple simultaneous connections efficiently.

### Data Validation

- **Pydantic Models**: Define all data schemas using Pydantic models to enforce type safety and data integrity.
- **Strict Validation**: Ensure that incoming and outgoing data adheres strictly to defined schemas, preventing
  malformed data from propagating through the system.

### Logging Practices

- **Structured Logging**: Utilize Loguru to implement structured logging, capturing detailed contextual information for
  each log entry.
- **Log Rotation and Retention**: Configure log rotation policies to manage log file sizes and implement retention
  strategies to preserve logs for a defined period.

### Reactive Programming

- **RxPY Integration**: Use ReactiveX (RxPY) to manage and manipulate event streams, enabling complex reactive data
  flows and transformations.
- **Observables and Subscriptions**: Implement observables for event streams and manage subscriptions effectively to
  handle dynamic data flows.

### CLI Development

- **Typer Framework**: Build the CLI using Typer to ensure a user-friendly and intuitive command-line experience.
- **Comprehensive Commands**: Implement a wide range of CLI commands for server management, event registration, log
  viewing, and more, facilitating efficient administrative tasks.

## Business Context

### Objectives

FastSocket aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for real-time messaging and logging, addressing the needs of
modern applications that require instantaneous data exchange and comprehensive monitoring capabilities. By automating
the generation of event handlers and frontend components from AsyncAPI specifications, FastSocket significantly reduces
development time and ensures consistency across the codebase.

### Target Audience

- **Validation Accuracy**: Maintain a reduced error rate in message validation through strict Pydantic models.
- **Scalability**: Seamlessly handle increasing loads without performance degradation.
- **Developer Productivity**: Enhance development efficiency through automated code generation and intuitive CLI tools.
- **Observability**: Provide comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities that facilitate quick troubleshooting and
  performance tuning.

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategies

- **Unit Testing**: Employ Pytest for unit tests covering individual modules, event handlers, and CLI commands.
- **Integration Testing**: Validate the interaction between different components, ensuring seamless data flow and event
  handling across the system.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate real-world scenarios to test the full functionality of FastSocket, from event
  emission to processing and logging.

### Testing Frameworks

- **Pytest**: For backend and CLI testing, ensuring all functionalities work as intended.
- **Jest**: For frontend component testing, verifying the correctness of generated Vue components and their
  interactions.

### Coverage and Benchmarks

- **Coverage Threshold**: Maintain a minimum of 95% test coverage across all modules to ensure code reliability and
  robustness.
- **Performance Benchmarks**:
    - **Response Time**: Ensure server response times remain under 200ms even under high concurrency.
    - **Log Management**: Validate the efficiency of log file handling, ensuring quick retrieval and minimal storage
      overhead.

## Deployment and Operations

### Containerization with Docker

- **Dockerfile**: Defines the container image for FastSocket, ensuring all dependencies are included and the application
  runs consistently across environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates multiple services, such as the FastSocket server and Logfire, facilitating seamless
  multi-service deployments.

### Orchestration with Kubernetes

- **Scalability**: Deploy FastSocket on a Kubernetes cluster to leverage horizontal scaling, load balancing, and
  automated failover mechanisms.
- **Configuration Management**: Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage environment variables and sensitive
  configurations securely.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

- **GitHub Actions**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring rapid
  and reliable delivery of updates.
    - **Continuous Integration**:
        - Linting and formatting checks using `flake8` and `black`.
        - Automated testing with Pytest and Jest.
        - Build verification using Poetry.
    - **Continuous Deployment**:
        - Containerization with Docker.
        - Deployment orchestration with Kubernetes.
        - Automated deployments triggered upon successful builds.

### Staging and Production Environments

- **Staging**: Utilize Docker Compose for local development and testing, simulating the production environment closely.
- **Production**: Deploy to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) with Kubernetes for high availability and
  scalability.

### Operational Procedures

- **Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance, event processing
  times, and resource utilization.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of critical issues, such as server downtime or
  performance bottlenecks.
- **Maintenance**: Implement regular maintenance schedules for updates, backups, and performance optimizations.
